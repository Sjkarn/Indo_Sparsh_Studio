          Case Studies: Real Businesses, Real Results
        </h1>

        <p className="blog-author">By Indo Sparsh Team</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          We talk a lot about strategies, tips, and frameworks. But nothing
          explains what we actually do better than showing you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past year, we've worked with founders, factory owners,
          restaurateurs, and retailers across India. Some came to us with clear
          problems. Others just knew something wasn't working.
        </p>

        <p>Here are five real businesses. Real challenges. Real outcomes.</p>

        <p>No embellishment. No made-up numbers. Just honest work.</p>

        <h2>Case Study 1: From Zero Visibility to 40% Organic Revenue</h2>

        <p>Client: Jaipur-based Ethnic Wear Brand</p>

        <p>Industry: E-commerce (Fashion)</p>

        <p>Team Size: 8 employees</p>

        <p>Engagement: 11 months</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>
          The client launched in 2022 with a beautiful website and great
          products. Handcrafted block prints, sustainable fabrics, fair pricing.
        </p>

        <p>But nobody came.</p>

        <p>
          They tried Instagram ads. Facebook campaigns. Google Shopping. Money
          went out. Orders trickled in. Their monthly ad spend of ₹1.2 lakhs was
          barely breaking even.
        </p>

        <p>
          The founder told us: "I have a shop in a dark alley. No one knows I
          exist."
        </p>

        <h2>What We Did</h2>

        <p>We didn't touch ads for the first 45 days.</p>

        <p>Phase 1: SEO Foundation (Months 1-2)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Audited their website: Slow loading, broken mobile menu, no meta
            descriptions
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed technical SEO: Site speed improved from 58 to 84 on mobile
          </li>
          <li>
            Researched keywords: Customers weren't searching "ethnic wear
            Jaipur"—they were searching "hand block print anarkali"
          </li>
          <li>
            Created content: 12 blog posts answering real customer questions
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Phase 2: Organic Growth (Months 3-6)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Published one high-quality post weekly</li>
          <li>Optimised product titles and descriptions</li>
          <li>Built 8 genuine backlinks from fashion bloggers</li>
          <li>Set up Google Business Profile with product categories</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Phase 3: Strategic Ads (Months 7-11)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reduced ad budget from ₹1.2L to ₹40,000</li>
          <li>Targeted only high-intent keywords</li>
          <li>Retargeted website visitors who didn't purchase</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Result</h2>

        <table className="blog-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Metric</th>
              <th>Before</th>
              <th>After (11 Months)</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>

          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Monthly Organic Sessions</td>
              <td>340</td>
              <td>4,200</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Organic Revenue Share</td>
              <td>8%</td>
              <td>41%</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Cost Per Order</td>
              <td>₹1,450</td>
              <td>₹620</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Total Monthly Revenue</td>
              <td>₹3.2L</td>
              <td>₹7.8L</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          Today, 4 out of every 10 rupees they earn comes from free traffic.
          Their ad dependency has dropped by 67%.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I used to think SEO was magic. Now I know it's just patience and
          consistency. Indo Sparsh didn't promise me quick wins. They promised
          steady work. They delivered exactly that."
