          Case Studies: Real Businesses, Real Results
        </h1>

        <p className="blog-author">By Indo Sparsh Team</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          We talk a lot about strategies, tips, and frameworks. But nothing
          explains what we actually do better than showing you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past year, we've worked with founders, factory owners,
          restaurateurs, and retailers across India. Some came to us with clear
          problems. Others just knew something wasn't working.
        </p>

        <p>Here are five real businesses. Real challenges. Real outcomes.</p>

        <p>No embellishment. No made-up numbers. Just honest work.</p>

        <h2>Case Study 1: From Zero Visibility to 40% Organic Revenue</h2>

        <p>Client: Jaipur-based Ethnic Wear Brand</p>

        <p>Industry: E-commerce (Fashion)</p>

        <p>Team Size: 8 employees</p>

        <p>Engagement: 11 months</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>
          The client launched in 2022 with a beautiful website and great
          products. Handcrafted block prints, sustainable fabrics, fair pricing.
        </p>

        <p>But nobody came.</p>

        <p>
          They tried Instagram ads. Facebook campaigns. Google Shopping. Money
          went out. Orders trickled in. Their monthly ad spend of ₹1.2 lakhs was
          barely breaking even.
        </p>

        <p>
          The founder told us: "I have a shop in a dark alley. No one knows I
          exist."
        </p>

        <h2>What We Did</h2>

        <p>We didn't touch ads for the first 45 days.</p>

        <p>Phase 1: SEO Foundation (Months 1-2)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Audited their website: Slow loading, broken mobile menu, no meta
            descriptions
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed technical SEO: Site speed improved from 58 to 84 on mobile
          </li>
          <li>
            Researched keywords: Customers weren't searching "ethnic wear
            Jaipur"—they were searching "hand block print anarkali"
          </li>
          <li>
            Created content: 12 blog posts answering real customer questions
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Phase 2: Organic Growth (Months 3-6)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Published one high-quality post weekly</li>
          <li>Optimised product titles and descriptions</li>
          <li>Built 8 genuine backlinks from fashion bloggers</li>
          <li>Set up Google Business Profile with product categories</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Phase 3: Strategic Ads (Months 7-11)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reduced ad budget from ₹1.2L to ₹40,000</li>
          <li>Targeted only high-intent keywords</li>
          <li>Retargeted website visitors who didn't purchase</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Result</h2>

        <table className="blog-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Metric</th>

              <td>8%</td>
              <td>41%</td>
            </tr>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          Today, 4 out of every 10 rupees they earn comes from free traffic.
          Their ad dependency has dropped by 67%.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I used to think SEO was magic. Now I know it's just patience and
          consistency. Indo Sparsh didn't promise me quick wins. They promised
          steady work. They delivered exactly that."
        </p>

        <p>— Kavita Sharma, Founder</p>

        <h2>Case Study 2: Turning Around a Loss-Making Café</h2>

        <p>Client: Delhi-based Café & Lounge</p>

        <p>Industry: Hospitality</p>

        <p>Team Size: 14 employees</p>

        <p>Engagement: 6 months</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>
          A charming café in South Delhi. Great coffee. Insta-worthy interiors.
          Weekends were busy. Weekdays were dead.
        </p>

        <p>
          The owner was exhausted. Rent was fixed. Staff salaries didn't pause.
          Monthly losses were averaging ₹1.1 lakhs.
        </p>

        <p>"We're popular, but we're not profitable. Something is broken."</p>

        <h2>What We Found</h2>

        <p>The problem wasn't footfall. It was concentration.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>70% of revenue came from Saturday-Sunday</li>
          <li>Weekday capacity utilisation: Under 20%</li>
          <li>Menu was too large—slow kitchen, high wastage</li>
          <li>
            No system for repeat visits: Customers came once, posted a photo,
            never returned
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Did</h2>

        <p>1. Weekday Activation</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Launched "Work From Café" membership: ₹999/month for unlimited
            coffee and high-speed WiFi
          </li>
          <li>Partnered with nearby offices for corporate lunch deliveries</li>
          <li>
            Introduced "Mondays with Moms"—play area, kids' menu, discounted
            chai
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>2. Menu Rationalisation</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reduced food items from 58 to 32</li>
          <li>Removed low-margin, low-selling dishes</li>
          <li>Introduced three signature items priced at premium</li>
        </ul>

        <p>3. Customer Retention</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Captured customer contacts via free WiFi login</li>
          <li>Sent weekly WhatsApp broadcast: "This week's special"</li>
          <li>Birthday discount auto-triggered via CRM</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Result</h2>

        <table className="blog-table">
          <thead>

              <td>₹720</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          The café is now profitable every month. Weekday revenues have tripled.
          The owner took a Friday off for the first time in three years.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I thought my problem was location. Then I thought it was food. Then I
          thought it was me. Indo Sparsh showed me I just needed a system, not a
          miracle."
        </p>

        <h2>Case Study 3: Data That Finally Worked for Telecallers</h2>

        <p>Client: Bangalore-based EdTech Startup</p>

        <p>Industry: Online Test Preparation</p>

        <p>Team Size: 22 employees (8 telecallers)</p>

        <p>Engagement: 5 months</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>
          The startup had a good product—affordable test series for government
          exam aspirants. They had a decent website. They had a team of 8
          telecallers sitting idle.
        </p>

        <p>Leads were coming in, but quality was poor.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Wrong numbers: 35%</li>
          <li>Students already enrolled elsewhere: 25%</li>
          <li>Genuine prospects: Less than 20%</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The founder: "My callers spend 7 hours dialling dead numbers. They're
          demotivated. I'm burning salary."
        </p>

        <h2>What We Did</h2>

        <p>1. Data Audit & Cleaning</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Analysed existing lead sources: Website forms, Google Ads, Facebook
            leads
          </li>
          <li>Identified highest-converting sources</li>
          <li>Removed channels generating high-volume, low-quality data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>2. Bulk Data Supply</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Started providing verified, intent-based data weekly</li>
          <li>Filtered by: Exam type, city, preparation year, budget range</li>
          <li>Eliminated duplicate and incorrect numbers before delivery</li>
        </ul>

        <p>3. Caller Enablement</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Created simple call scripts (not robotic, just structured)</li>
          <li>Trained team on handling objections</li>
          <li>Set daily targets: Not calls made, but conversations had</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Result</h2>

        <table className="blog-table">

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          The telecaller team moved from cost centre to revenue centre.
          Attrition dropped. Morale improved.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Every agency promised us more leads. Indo Sparsh was the only one who
          asked: 'What quality of leads do you actually need?' That question
          changed everything."

        <p>Engagement: 8 months</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>
          A 22-year-old family business. Two generations. Solid reputation.
          Loyal clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also: Paper invoices. Excel sheets with different formats across
          branches. No central visibility of pending payments. Owner worked 14
          hours daily because "only I know how things run."
        </p>

        <p>"My son wants me to retire. But if I stop, everything stops."</p>

        <h2>What We Did</h2>

        <p>1. Process Documentation</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Spent 3 weeks shadowing the owner and senior staff</li>
          <li>
            Mapped every workflow: Order booking, billing, dispatch, payment
            collection
          </li>
          <li>Created 22 standard operating procedure documents</li>
        </ul>

        <p>2. Custom Software Solution</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Built a simple, browser-based tracking system</li>
          <li>Consolidated data from all branches into one dashboard</li>
          <li>Automated invoice generation and payment reminders</li>
        </ul>

        <p>3. Team Training</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Conducted 12 training sessions across Chennai, Trichy, Madurai
          </li>
          <li>Appointed "process champions" at each branch</li>
          <li>Shifted owner from operator to supervisor</li>

        <p>
          The owner now takes Sundays off. His son handles client meetings. The
          business didn't need a tech revolution—it needed simple systems
          executed well.

        <p>
          *"I thought software would be complicated. Indo Sparsh built something

        <p>Client: Kochi-based Organic Products Brand</p>

        <p>Industry: FMCG (Health Foods)</p>

        <p>Team Size: 6 employees</p>

        <p>Engagement: 4 months</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>
          The product was excellent—cold-pressed coconut oil, organic spices,
          traditional pickles made without preservatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the brand looked like a commodity. Stock photography. Basic logo.
          Packaging that disappeared on store shelves.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Customers say 'I've seen this somewhere' but never remember our
          name."
        </p>

        <h2>What We Did</h2>

        <p>1. Brand Strategy</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Defined brand personality: Not "healthy food" but "mother's kitchen,
            modernised"
          </li>
          <li>
            Created brand voice guidelines: Warm, trustworthy, Kerala-rooted
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed brand story: Third-generation family recipe, now in your
            city
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>2. Visual Identity</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Designed new logo: Modern but hand-drawn feel</li>
          <li>
            Created packaging system: Consistent across 12 SKUs, instantly
            recognisable
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed photo library: Real products, real ingredients, real
            Kerala backdrops
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>3. Digital Presence</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Redesigned website: Product-first, mobile-optimised</li>
          <li>
            Created Instagram identity: Less "buy now", more "here's how we make
            this"
          </li>
          <li>Launched Amazon store with professional imagery</li>

          The brand now has a face, a voice, and a memory. Customers don't just
          buy—they remember.

          "We were selling food. Indo Sparsh helped us sell trust. That's a very
          different business."

        <h2>Case Study 6: The Pivot That Saved a Travel Business</h2>

        <p>Client: Vadodara-based Travel Agency</p>

        <p>Industry: Travel & Tourism</p>

        <p>Team Size: 9 employees</p>

        <p>Engagement: 12 months (ongoing)</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>
          Pre-2020, this was a thriving leisure travel agency. Family holidays,
          honeymoon packages, group tours.
        </p>

        <p>Then the pandemic hit. Then recovery. Then another dip.</p>

        <p>
          By early 2025, leisure travel was back—but competition was brutal.
          Margins had compressed. OTAs were undercutting everyone. The owner was
          considering shutting down.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I've been in travel for 31 years. I don't know what business I'm in
          anymore."
        </p>

        <h2>What We Did</h2>

        <p>1. Market Reassessment</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Analysed where demand was actually growing</li>
          <li>
            Discovered: Manufacturing units in Vadodara, Ankleshwar, Halol
            needed corporate travel management
          </li>
          <li>No local agency was serving them professionally</li>
        </ul>

        <p>2. Strategic Pivot</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Shifted focus from leisure B2C to corporate B2B</li>
          <li>
            Developed corporate travel packages: Factory visits, vendor
            meetings, exhibition travel
          </li>
          <li>Created subscription model: Monthly retainer + actual costs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>3. Sales & Marketing</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Built targeted list of 200+ manufacturing units within 100 km</li>
          <li>Cold visited 65 companies in 45 days</li>
          <li>Offered free travel audit as entry point</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Result</h2>

        <table className="blog-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Metric</th>

              <th>After (12 Months)</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>

          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Revenue Mix (Leisure:Corporate)</td>
              <td>85:15</td>
              <td>32:68</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Monthly Retainers</td>
              <td>0</td>
              <td>23</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Revenue vs Pre-Pivot</td>
              <td>-62%</td>
              <td>+18%</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Weekend Work</td>
              <td>Mandatory</td>
              <td>Optional</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          The business didn't just survive—it found a new identity. Leisure
          travel remains, but corporate is now the backbone.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Pivoting felt like failure. Now I realise: Staying stuck was the real
          failure. Indo Sparsh gave me permission to change."
        </p>

        <p>— Rajesh Desai, Owner</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

        <p>
          Every business has a story. Some are about struggle. Some about
          breakthrough. Most are about both.
        </p>

        <p>
          We don't claim credit for our clients' success. They took the risk.
          They did the work. They trusted someone outside their industry.
        </p>

        <p>We just brought clarity, process, and a fresh pair of eyes.</p>

        <p>
          If your business has a story worth telling—or a problem worth
          solving—we'd like to hear it.
        </p>
